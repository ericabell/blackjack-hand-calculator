# A Blackjack hand calculator

But the rules are different than playing Blackjack.

1. We have to look at the entire hand, not just when we 'BUST'.
1. Aces will count as either 1 or 11, whichever gets the total closer to 21.

## Process

1. Add up all the cards and keep track of the number of aces.
1. Look at the total and decide if the aces should count as 1 or 11 based on
the total of the other cards in the hand.
1. Return the total.
